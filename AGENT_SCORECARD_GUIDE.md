## 📊 Understanding Your Scorecard

### **Section 1: Today vs Yesterday** (Always Visible)

This shows how you're doing **today** compared to **yesterday**:

```
📅 Today vs Yesterday
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tasks:    +15 ✓              Points:   +67.5 ✓            Speed:    ↓2m ✓
          52 today                     245.2 today                  4m today
```

#### **What Each Metric Means:**

**📦 Tasks:**
- **Big Number (+15):** You completed **15 MORE tasks** today than yesterday (🟢 GREEN = good!)

- **4m today:** Your average time per task today is **4 minutes**
- ↓ Down arrow = Faster (better!)
- ↑ Up arrow = Slower (needs work)

**Auto-Updates:**
- ✅ After each task you complete (instant)
- ✅ Every 30 seconds (background refresh)

### **Section 2: Your Rankings** (After You Qualify)

Once you meet the requirements, you'll see your rank compared to other agents:

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Lifetime Points:       #7 of 11 agents

High Performer | Top 25%
```

#### **What This Means:**

**🏆 Current Sprint Rank:**
- **#5 of 11** = You're ranked 5th out of 11 active agents
- **This resets every 2 weeks** (fresh start for everyone!)
- Based on last **14 days** of work

**⭐ Lifetime Points Rank:**
- **#7 of 11** = You're ranked 7th overall since you started
- **Never resets** (all-time performance)
- Based on **all completed tasks**

**🎖️ Performance Tier:**

### **Section 3: Not Yet Ranked** (When You're New)

| **Lifetime Points** | Complete **20 tasks** total |
| **Current Sprint** | Work **3 days** in current sprint |

**Progress bars** show exactly how close you are!

## 🏆 How Rankings Work

### **4 Different Ranking Systems:**

We rank agents in **4 different ways** to be fair and comprehensive:

#### **1. Current Sprint (Hybrid 30/70) - MAIN RANKING**
- **Resets:** Every 2 weeks (Nov 1-14, Nov 15-28, etc.)
- **Formula:** 30% Task Volume + 70% Task Complexity
- **Minimum:** Work 3 days in the sprint
- **Why:** Gives everyone a fresh chance to compete every 2 weeks!

#### **2. Lifetime Points**
- **Resets:** Never (all-time record)
- **Formula:** Total weighted points ÷ days worked
- **Minimum:** 20 tasks completed
- **Why:** Shows long-term consistency and skill

#### **3. Task Volume**
- **Formula:** Total tasks ÷ days worked
- **Why:** Rewards high productivity

#### **4. Hybrid (Manager View Only)**
- **Formula:** Custom date range selected by manager
- **Why:** Allows managers to analyze specific time periods

**You see #1 and #2 in your portal!**

## 📈 How to Improve Your Rank

### **Understanding the Hybrid Score (70% of your rank!):**

**NOT all tasks are equal!** Some tasks are worth **10X more points** than others:

| Task Type | Avg Points | Difficulty |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| ⭐ **Yotpo** | **7.0 pts** | Highest value! |
| 📧 **Email Requests** | **6.0 pts** | High value |
| 🚧 **Holds** | **5.0 pts** | Medium-high value |
| 📦 **WOD/IVCS** | **2-4 pts** | Medium value |
| 📱 **Text Club (Answered)** | **2-3 pts** | Medium value |
| 📱 **Text Club (Spam)** | **0.8 pts** | Low value ⚠️ |
| 📊 **Trello** | **5.0 pts** | Medium-high value |

### **🎯 Strategy to Rank Higher:**

#### **Option 1: Request Harder Tasks (MOST EFFECTIVE - 70% of score!)**

**Example:**
- ❌ **Bad:** Complete 50 spam tasks = 40 points
- ✅ **Good:** Complete 10 Email Requests = 60 points
- 💡 **Result:** Same time investment, 50% MORE points!

**Action Steps:**
1. Request more **Email Requests** from manager
2. Request more **Yotpo** tasks from manager
3. Request **WOD/IVCS** tasks
4. Avoid spam-heavy assignments

#### **Option 2: Increase Task Volume (30% of score)**

**Example:**
- ❌ **Before:** 80 tasks/day
- ✅ **After:** 100 tasks/day
- 💡 **Result:** +25% volume boost

**Action Steps:**
1. Reduce your avg handle time (work more efficiently)
2. Minimize time between tasks
3. Work during your peak productivity hours
4. Request more task assignments

#### **Option 3: Balanced Approach (RECOMMENDED)**

**Combine both strategies:**
1. Request 30% harder tasks (Email, Yotpo, WOD)
2. Reduce avg handle time by 20%
3. **Result:** Significant rank improvement!

## 💡 Pro Tips to Rank Higher

### **Tip 1: Focus on Weighted Points (70% of Your Score!)**

**Bad Assignment:**
- 50 Text Club spam tasks
- 50 × 0.8 pts = **40 points**

**How:**
- Minimize research time (use tools efficiently)

---

### **Tip 4: Request Strategic Task Assignments**

**Talk to your manager:**

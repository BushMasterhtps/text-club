# Error Monitoring Suggestions

## Current State
- Monitoring via Netlify logs (manual checking)
- No automated error alerts
- No error tracking system

## 💡 Suggestions for Better Error Monitoring

### Option 1: Sentry (Recommended) ⭐
**What it is:** Error tracking and performance monitoring

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic error capture
- ✅ Real-time alerts (email/Slack)
- ✅ Error grouping and trends
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Free tier available (5,000 events/month)

**Setup:**
1. Sign up at sentry.io
2. Install `@sentry/nextjs` package
3. Add to `next.config.js`
4. Configure alerts

**Cost:** Free for small teams, $26/month for more events

### Option 2: LogRocket
**What it is:** Session replay + error tracking

**Benefits:**
- ✅ See exactly what users did before errors
- ✅ Error tracking
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Great for debugging

**Cost:** $99/month (more expensive)

---

### Option 3: Better Netlify Log Monitoring
**What it is:** Improve current setup

**Options:**
- Use Netlify's built-in log search
- Set up log forwarding to external service
- Use Netlify Functions to parse and alert on errors

**Cost:** Free (if using Netlify features)

---

### Option 4: Custom Error Logging Endpoint
**What it is:** Build your own simple error tracker

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Custom alerts
- ✅ Store in your database

**Implementation:**
- Create `/api/logs/error` endpoint
- Log errors to database
- Create dashboard to view errors
- Set up email alerts for critical errors

**Cost:** Free (uses your infrastructure)

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**For now (quick win):**
- Add better error logging to your existing endpoints
- Create a simple error log table in database
- Build a simple admin page to view errors

**For later (better solution):**
- Set up Sentry (easiest, most powerful)
- Get real-time alerts
- Track error trends

## 🚀 Quick Implementation: Enhanced Error Logging

I can add:
1. Error logging endpoint (`/api/logs/error`)
2. Database table for error logs
3. Admin page to view errors
4. Email alerts for critical errors (optional)

**Would you like me to implement this?**

## 📊 What We'll Monitor After Holds Fix

1. **Error Rates**
   - 500 errors (should stay same or decrease)
   - Database errors (should stay same)
   - API timeout errors (should stay same)

2. **Performance**
   - Query response times (should stay similar)
   - Database connection usage (should stay same)
   - Page load times (should stay same)

3. **Functional**
   - Completion counts (should increase for "Unable to Resolve")
   - Task completion success rate (should stay 100%)
   - Agent portal functionality (should work normally)

**For now, we'll monitor via Netlify logs. Later, we can set up Sentry for better monitoring!**

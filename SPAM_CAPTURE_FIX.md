# Spam Capture Bug Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Reported

**Date**: October 30, 2025

### Problem Summary:
1. ❌ **Over-capture**: Imported 700 messages, but 1100+ were moved to spam
2. ❌ **Old messages captured**: Messages from 9/8/2025 were being flagged (already completed)
3. ❌ **False positives**: Legitimate requests captured as spam
4. ❌ **Substring matching**: "cod" matching "code", "could"; "liver" matching "delivered"

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. Substring Matching Instead of Word Matching
**Problem**: The `CONTAINS` mode was using JavaScript's `.includes()` which does substring matching:
```typescript
// OLD CODE:
if (r.mode === SpamMode.CONTAINS) return t.includes(p);
```

**Impact**:
- "cod" matched: "**cod**e", "**cod**ing", "en**cod**ed", "**could**"
- "liver" matched: "de**liver**", "de**liver**ed", "o**liver**"
- "topi" matched: "u**topi**a", "myo**topi**a"

### 2. No Date Filtering
**Problem**: Spam capture scanned ALL messages in database, not just recent imports:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - No date filter:
where: { status: { in: [RawStatus.READY, RawStatus.PROMOTED] } }
```

**Impact**:
- Scanned old completed messages from months ago
- Caused the over-capture (1100 vs 700 expected)

### 3. Default Mode is CONTAINS
**Problem**: When adding spam rules through UI, they default to `CONTAINS` mode (too broad).

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Word-Boundary Matching

**Updated Files**:
- `src/app/api/manager/spam/capture/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/manager/spam/preview/route.ts`
- `src/lib/spam.ts`

**New Logic**:
```typescript
if (r.mode === SpamMode.CONTAINS) {
  const words = t.split(/\s+/);
  const patternWords = p.split(/\s+/);
  
  // For single-word patterns, check if it exists as a complete word
  if (patternWords.length === 1) {
    return words.some(word => word === p);
  }
  
  // For multi-word patterns, check if the phrase exists with word boundaries
  const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${p.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')}\\b`);
  return regex.test(t);
}
```

**Now**:
- ✅ "cod" matches only "cod" (not "code", "could", "encoded")
- ✅ "liver" matches only "liver" (not "delivered", "delivery")
- ✅ "topi" matches only "topi" (not "utopia", "myotopia")

### Fix #2: Date Filtering (7-Day Window)

**Added to All Spam Detection Endpoints**:
```typescript
// Only scan messages from the last 7 days
const sevenDaysAgo = new Date();
sevenDaysAgo.setDate(sevenDaysAgo.getDate() - 7);

const batch = await prisma.rawMessage.findMany({
  where: { 
    status: { in: [RawStatus.READY, RawStatus.PROMOTED] },
    createdAt: { gte: sevenDaysAgo } // Only recent messages
  },
  // ...
});
```

**Now**:
- ✅ Only scans messages from last 7 days
- ✅ Won't capture old completed messages
- ✅ Capture count matches import count

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Spam Capture Example:

**Your Rules**: "cod", "liver", "topi", "squeeki", "topi jasmine"

**Test Messages**:

| Message | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| "Can I use my cod?" | ✅ Captured | ✅ Captured |
| "Can I use this code?" | ❌ **Wrongly captured** | ✅ NOT captured |
| "Could you help me?" | ❌ **Wrongly captured** | ✅ NOT captured |
| "Where is my delivered order?" | ❌ **Wrongly captured** ("liver") | ✅ NOT captured |
| "I need fresh liver" | ✅ Captured | ✅ Captured |
| "Send squeeki toy please" | ✅ Captured | ✅ Captured |
| "Topi Jasmine order" | ✅ Captured | ✅ Captured |

### Capture Count Example:

**Scenario**: Import 700 new messages today

**Old Behavior**:
- Scans: ALL messages in database (5000+)
- Captures: 1100+ (including old messages from 9/8/2025)
- ❌ Incorrect

**New Behavior**:
- Scans: Only messages from last 7 days (~800)
- Captures: Matches within those ~800 (close to your expected count)
- ✅ Correct

## 🚀 Deployment

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/app/api/manager/spam/capture/route.ts` - Main capture endpoint
2. ✅ `src/app/api/manager/spam/preview/route.ts` - Preview endpoint
3. ✅ `src/lib/spam.ts` - Spam labeling function

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix spam capture: word-boundary matching + 7-day window"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will auto-deploy.

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Word Boundary Matching
1. Add a test rule: "cod"
2. Create test messages:
   - "Can I use cod?" → **Should be captured**
   - "Can I use code?" → **Should NOT be captured**
   - "Could you help?" → **Should NOT be captured**
3. Run spam capture
4. Verify only the first message is captured

### Test 2: Date Filtering
1. Check your oldest pending message (should be within 7 days)
2. Run spam capture
3. Check spam review queue
4. Verify NO messages older than 7 days appear

### Test 3: Accurate Count
1. Import a known number of messages (e.g., 100)
2. Run spam capture
3. Note the "updated count"
4. Verify it's ≤ 100 (not 2x or 3x your import)

## 📝 Notes for Future

### If You Need Different Behavior:

**Adjust the date window** (currently 7 days):
- For shorter window (3 days): Change `sevenDaysAgo.setDate(sevenDaysAgo.getDate() - 3);`
- For longer window (14 days): Change to `-14`

**Use LONE mode for exact full-text matching**:
- LONE mode requires the ENTIRE message to match exactly
- Example: Pattern "stop" with LONE mode only matches messages that say exactly "stop"

**Use REGEX mode for advanced patterns**:
- Not currently implemented in the UI
- Would require adding regex pattern support

## 🎯 Summary

### Before:
- ❌ "cod" captured "code", "could", "encoded"
- ❌ Scanned ALL messages (old + new)
- ❌ Over-captured by 50%+

### After:
- ✅ "cod" only captures exact word "cod"
- ✅ Only scans messages from last 7 days
- ✅ Accurate capture counts

**Impact**: Dramatically reduced false positives, accurate capture counts, no more old message recapture.
